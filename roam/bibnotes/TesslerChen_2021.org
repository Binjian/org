#+title: Tessler, Chen :: Deep Reinforcement Learning Works - Now What?

        - the gap between theory and practice
        - infinite horizon with stationary model
        - regularization with noise
        - hyperparameter sensitivity
        - algorithm novelty vs performance: performance might be acheived by simple augmentation + simple policy, novelty of method have truly result?
        - evaluation environment? simple and direct
