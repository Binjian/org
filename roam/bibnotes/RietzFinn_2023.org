#+title: Rietz, Finn :: Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning with Lexicographic Task-priority constraints

        - sample inefficiency
        - reward is scalar, to optimize complex tasks is difficult, multi-objective?
        - unsafe exploration of trial and error based , blackbox-nature of reuslting DNN based agents,
