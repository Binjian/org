** Sensing
*** Marigold
*** 3D Pose estimation
- VIO: Kimera-VIO + SLAM (pose, slam from CPU + semantic from GPU)
  - VIO & Robot Pose estimation
  - 3D metric/semantic environment reconstruction

*** as intepretablitiy output (risk assessment)
*** for layered motion planning
** Planning
*** optimal control
**** Nonlinear Online MPC (Yuval Tassa)
***** cost function design
***** Cannot handle complex
***** Model needs to be known (issue transferred to system identification), very difficult to impossible for complex dynamic tasks
***** model has to be global
**** --> Neural Network: Learning NN Policy with guided policy search under unknown dynamics (Levine & Abberl 2014):
***** Guilded Policy Search: PG method with Gaussson Mixed Model, Trust Region (PO)
***** time variant linear dynamic model,
***** learning local model
**** Bertesekas: Optimal control --> RL
** Control
