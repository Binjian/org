\section{Introduction}

Drivers with diverse driving experience tend to have quite different fuel or electricity consumption on the same vehicle and the same driving route. The general common sense is that the driving styles, i.e., how drivers operate the vehicle through acceleration and brake, have an impact on the vehicle energy consumption. We would expect there exists an experienced driver with a specific driving style can handle various road conditions to achieve the optimal energy efficiency. This leads us to the assumption that if we could apply an agent which observe the driving dynamics and adjusts the driving operation, we could reduce the energy consumption. If we choose the right observation and action, we could optimize the energy consumption online or offline for driving the vehicle with a general paradigm based on learning methods so that we can leverage a large mount of easily available driving data.

Nevertheless, the application of deep reinforcement learning in the real world is generally difficult \parencite{Irpan_2018}. The main reasons include the sample inefficiency, reward shaping challenge, local optima, overfitting to rare patterns, unstable training, hyperparameter sensitivity. Most known successful applications of deep reinforcement learning can be found in games \parencite{mnih13:_playin_atari_deep_reinf_learn}, \parencite{DBLP:journals/nature/SilverHMGSDSAPL16}, \parencite{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BrownS17}, \parencite{openai19:_dota_large_scale_deep_reinf_learn}, \parencite{bakhtin22:_Human_level_diplomacy_cicero}, where the system dynamics are deterministic or closely deterministic.
If the system dynamics is deterministic or very well known and a good simulation is available, then an enormous amount of samples can be generated for training. Furthermore for games specifically, self-play can be used for learning \parencite{Silver_2018}.

In recent years, robotics is the domain with growing successful deployment of deep reinforcement learning in the real world, particularly in manipulation, grasping and legged locomotion. Diverse techniques are used. Usually simulation is leveraged to have a good model for transfer learning in the real world. In particular privileged information of the system dynamics is used to have dedicated modules to explicitly deal with environment changes \parencite{kumar21:_rma}, to learn the alignment of proprioception with exteroception \parencite{Miki_2022}, or to just use a specialized initialization strategy, randomized physical parameters and intentional delay in simulation for efficient exploration \parencite{Song_2023}. Furthermore, \parencite{Hoeller_2024} focuses on limited skill sets to have a modular model structure to increase the learning efficiency.\ \parencite{smith23:_grow_your_limit} constrains the policy in a principled way to the familiar system dynamics to increase the learning efficiency in the real world.\ \parencite{wu22:_daydr} leverages the world model and efficient sequential latent encoding of the system dynamics. Overall robotics learning tends to use more imitation learning and utilize offline data, as it's still hard to search for the generic reinforcement learning and extra pre-training and supervised fine-tuning is cheaper \parencite{Irpan_2024}.

In the automotive industry, one of the most evident applicaion would be autonomous driving. But there's no available public work of autonomous driving in the real world that's based on deep reinforcement learning framework in a principled way. More attention is paid to leveraging simulation to generate sufficient training samples or using prior knowledge in pretrained foundational models and scaling up.

In general, there's no generic end-to-end deep reinforcement learning method for real world applications, but a paradigm to combine deep reinforcement learning with domain specific techniques to alleviate the aforementioned challenges. As each problem in the real world have its specific prior information and exploitable inductive biases, it's only natural to exploit them in an engineering way.

This paper gives an example that progress in real world applications can be achieved with deep reinforcement learning. While research concerns might be alleviated with design choices, the practical deployment should still comply with the basic requirements of the theories stringently without loss of validity. Eventually in long term, issues of multimodality and out-of-distribution matter in complex and very long time horizon. On the practical side, deployment of reward-driven learning methods can promote the industry to leverage abundant available online or offline domain data and interfaces to achieve continuous and dynamic optimization in many complex industrial processes which require the large capacity of deep neural networks and have the potential to help reshaping the industry into the data-driven paradigm.

\subsection{Related work}\label{sec:related}

Electric vehicles (EVs) have been growing in popularity in the automotive industry with sales increasing globally. The share of electric cars in total sales has increased from negligibly less than 0.1\% in 2010 to 14\% in 2022 \parencite{statista_2023}. The deployment of EVs is largely due to the rising fuel economy standards and the required reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which leads to the increasing complexity of powertrains in the form of additional actuators and control systems. The energy efficiency of EVs has been the focus of powertrain electrification. In \parencite{Egan_2023} an overview of the reinforcement learning methods applied in powertrain controllers in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) is given. They reviewed the state, action space and the reward function of their design choices.

For example, \parencite{Wang_2020} exploits the physical models of extended range electric electric vehciles (EREVs) in the investigation so that the chosen state consists of the traveled distance and time, fuel use and the GPS coordinates of the vehicle and in particular the ``energy compensated expected trip distance'' which by their definition is the expected total trip distance multiplied by a ratio of trip energy intensity and the expected one. The chosen action is the range of the constructed state. The reward function is designed as weighted sum of the penaltes of internal combustion engine (ICE) operation, low state of charge (SOC), change of the constructed state and a specific terminal state. In \parencite{Hou_2022} the state is defined as the power demand and SOC, the action is the fuel cell power, while the reward is a weighted sum of the change rate of the instantaneous hydrogen consumption, a qudratic poloynomial of the battery power with cooefficients containing open-circuit voltage, cell capacity and battery internal resistance in order to reduce unnecessary energy storation while keep the action feasiblity of the electric motor and the ICE.\@ Similarly, \parencite{Hu_2018} selects for HEVs the total required torque and SOC as state and the output torque of ICE as action which is equivalent to the power-split of HEV between the electric motor and ICE, while the reward is defined as the reciprocal of instantaneous fuel consumption of the ICE conditioned on the range of itself and the instantaneous SOC\@.

It can be seen that these methods exploit the domain specific knowledge for each of the vehicle model under investigation to select the state and action. The constructed and estimated expectation state signals which are not directly measured contain further biases and noise. Besides, the measureable state signals in those applications require specific sensors or processing and are thus expensive to acquire. Furthermore, it should be noted that even the SOC cannot be directly measured in real time while the vehicle is driving so it's estimated from the measured voltage and a lookup table acquired by calibration. The selected actions serve their specific objective domains and therefore cannot be generalized to other vehicle models. The reward shaping in those applications are never the energy consumption directly, since the objective is to optimize the co-operation of eletric motor and ICE for HEV\@. It's usually a heuristic mixture of electricity and fuel consumption with constraints which are required to regularized the system behavior but in general detrimental to the optimization performance. The weights in the reward brings extra hyperparameters which are sensitive to the system performance and difficult to analyze.

The review of the applications of deep reinforcement learning in EVs makes us wonder whether we can use the energy consumption directly as reward, while taking observation directly from the vehicle dynamics and driver behavior. The objective would not be the optimization of the co-operation of the mixed powertrain components, but the optimization of overall powertrain dynamic behavior conditioned on the road environment and driver operation. We'd call such a system ``Energy Optimization System of Electric Vehcicle '' (EOSEV). Such a system would be generic and applicable for any type of EVs since all the required observations, actions and rewards would be available and easily measureable. The challenge is to learn the complex system dynamics of driving in the real world condition.

It shoud be noted that the method would applicable for regular ICE vehicles as well. We experiment on a BEV, since it has a simplistic yet powerful electric powertrain. The electric motor has a much faster torque response than ICE, therefore the measurements are more precise and have better real-time performance which is crucial to guarantee the causality of actions, states and rewards.

Empirically, the optimization space of the driving operation comes from the way to adaptively adjust the vehicle speed by acceleration or deceleration to reach the target position with the target speed. Usually a smooth speed transition is better than abrupt acceleration or braking which causes large currents in the electric motor and results in more electricity consumption. One particular feature of EVs is regenerative braking system (RBS) \parencite{enwiki:1228286642}, which lets the vehicle recapture energy from momentum by running the electric motor in reverse to recharge the battery with a negative torque request. The regenrative braking system improves the energy efficiency and is now a standard part of many electrified vehicle including HEVs and BEVs. The parameters of the RBS are contained in the electironic control unit (ECU) of the vehicle powertrain controller which is called vehicle control units (VCU). Usually the RBS doesn't depend on road conditions or driver operations and is implicitly static. However, if we choose the action so that it can impact the RBS, under the EOSEV the RBS can be exploited by the agent like the other acceleration or braking strategies. We observe in the experiment that even without explicitly modeling the RBS behaviour in the system, the RBS is actively and legitmately exploited by the agent to reduce the energy consumption without any explicit built-in rules or modeling.

\section{Preliminary}\label{sec:intro:preliminary}

In order to increase the energy efficiency while driving, we consider the following structure in Fig.\@\ref{fig:Agent_Powertrain}. Without the agent and its connection to the input (observation) and the output (action), the parameters of the powertrain controller are kept static, the depicted process is a regular powertrain control with the driver in the loop. The driver controls the vehicle speed through acceleration and brake pedal while observing the road condition.

\end{figure*}

When the agent is connected to the regular system as depicted, it will get the vehicle speed $V$, the driver's operation on the acceleration pedal $A$ and the brake pedal $B$ from the on-board sensors as its observation. $(V,A,B)$ is defined as the state of EOSEV system. In order to reduce the observation dimensionality, we take only the longitudinal control the vehicle, namely the electric powertrain into account, since the lateral operation through the steering wheel has far less impact on the energy consumption than the longitudinal control. Given a series of $(V,A,B)$ for a short period of time, an experienced human driver is usually able to predict and choose the next appropriate strategy to accelerate or decelerate in an energy efficient way. The negative of the engergy consumption, which is the product of the voltage $U$ and the current $I$ from the sensors in powertrain, $U\cdot V$, when multiplied by a time constant, is directly taken as the instantaneous reward. Here we have the real reward. The action $\Delta\tau$ is chosen to be the change of torque request incrementally added onto the ``pedal map'' of the VCU\@.

\end{figure}

The pedal map is a two-dimensional table which outputs the torque request to the electric motor for a given acceleration pedal opening and a certain vehicle speed. It's a static map for a regular powertrain controller, as depicted in Fig.\@\ref{fig:initial pedal map}. The requested torque, once exerted by the electric motor, is proportional to teh vehicle acceleration. It's usually acquired by vehicle calibration during the pre-development of the EV model. A calibration engineer will generate different pedal maps by testing drives on proving ground or real road and determine table items empirically and by experimental validation. The different pedal maps will correspond to different driving styles which are provided as features to the customers, such as ``Normal'', ``Sport'' or ``Economic''. The customers will choose a pedal map through a vehicle HMI to match their driving style requirements. We select the ``Economic'' pedal map as the default initial pedal map for the agent and check how much the agent can further improve the energy efficiency. The pedal map increases monotonically with the acceleration pedal opening, while decreasing monotonically with the vehicle speed. The maximal torque request occurs when the vehicle starts off and the drive steps on the pedal with full throttle. The map region with low speed ($\leq10kmph$) and negligible pedal openings has the largest the negative torque request, which corresponds to motor in reverse, i.e.\ strong regenerative braking. These are all by design.

When the agent change the torque request for a given range of vehicle speeds under a give pedal opening, the corresponding region of the pedal map will be changed by $\Delta\tau$. If the training occurs on a urban road, we can see the low speed region under 60 kmph is changed as depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:dynamic pedal map}. The resulting pedal map is the sum of the initial map and integration of the action up to the current moment. In our experiment the agent is allowed to change the items all over the map region, which allows implicitly the exploitation of the regenerative braking.

\section{Method}\label{sec:method}

Once the design choice for the state, action, and reward are made, we apply the standard reinforcment learning, see Fig.\@\ref{fig:policy gradient}. We use a customized Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm \parencite{lillicrap15:_contin} due to its sample efficiency and continuous action space. The implementation is based on \parencite{keras20:DDPG}. During training, both the critic and the actor are updated with gradient descent by the reward signal, while for inference only the actor is required. Both the reward function $\mathcal{R}_a^s$ which generates the energy consumption and the system dynamic $\mathcal{P}_{ss'}^{a}$ which determines the state transition come from the real world. During training we keep a replay buffer to take new observations and sample batches from it.

	\caption{\label{fig:rl_model} The policy gradient method}\label{fig:policy gradient}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Model}\label{sec:model}

The neural networks for the critic and actor are depicted in Fig.\@\ref{fig:actorcritic}. We choose basic multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for both the actor and critic network. The activation function for the output layer of the actor network is $\tanh$ function which squeezes the output to $\left[0,1\right)$. Fig.\@\ref{fig:critic} also shows the training of the actor and critic, while Fig.\@\ref{fig:actor} is for the inference.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:setup}

The training setup is important for the agent to learn a good policy. As a basic requirement for reinforcement learning, the training should be episodic. We first choose a short episode with a target speed profile as depicted in Fig.\@\ref{fig:speed profile for traning}, while the vehicle is simply driven forward. From a standstill, the vehicle needs to be accelerated to a maximal speed of around 17kmph. After deceleration it return to its standstill state. An upperbound and lowerbound is set for allowed maximal deviation from the desired target speed. If the actual speed is out of the bound for longer than three seconds, the test episode is invalid or should be interrupted prematurely and the data is abandoned. The test is carried out on a proving ground with no traffic or pedestrian. With this simple speed profile we expect the agent to learn the basic policy of acceleration and deceleration and thus be prepared for more complex scenarios.

\subsubsection{Record}\label{sec:record}

The data in the reinforcement learning model are shown in Tab.\@\ref{tab:quadruple}. The definitions and special notes:

\begin{description}
	\item[State $s_t$]
        \item Since DDPG is not a sequential model, we take the array of $K$ subsequent observations of $(V,A,B)$ as state $s_{t}=(V_{1},A_{1},B_{1},\ldots,V_{K},A_{K},B_{K})$, where each observation is a CAN frame. In the experiment, $K=30$, which amounts to 1.5 seconds of observation for the frame rate at 20 Hz, thus the state dimension for input layers in Fig.\@\ref{fig:actorcritic} is 90. The actor outputs the action $\Delta\tau$ given the state array.
	\item[Action $a_t$]
        \item The dimension of the pedal map in our experiment is $17\times 21$, where the columns axis corresponds to acceleration pedal opening from 0\% to 100\% and the rows axis to the speed range of 0 kmph to 100 kmph. The torque request of the ``Economic'' map ranges from around -2 kNm to 4.4 kNm. While the whole region of the pedal map can be changed by action, it's usually not necessary. Since the acceleration of the vehicle is limited in the usual driving senarios, we choose the action dimension to be $17\times 4=68$, namely 4 rows of the map depending on the observed speed values in the state.  This corresponds to a maximal acceleration of 0.37$g$ (or $3.7m/s^{2}$). While the output of the actor $a_{t}=\Delta\tau$ will change any rows of the pedal map depending on the the speed of the vehicle, the same actor network is used, which means the agent share the same policy for changing the torque request under different speeds. The sharing of same network for different observation reduces the model capacity as well as computation.

	\item[Reward]
        \item $r_{t}=\Sigma_{k=1}^{K}(U_{k}\cdot I_{k})$.

	\item[Causality]
        \item Care needs to be taken regarding causality of the signals and the credit assignment of the actions. Since $\Delta\tau$ is computed by the agent after receiving the state array, it will only impact the driving after the pedal map has been written into the VCU flash memory and the eletric motor exerts the requested torque physically, which means only the energy consumption after the torque exertion should be attributed to this action as reward. After receiving the sequence of the raw observations, caching and reordering are necessary. For example, the reward $r_{t}$ for the current action $a_{t}$ comes from the next 1.5 seconds, while the reward in the current observation should be attributed to the last action. Therefore in the next 1.5 seconds only the reward is collected after the action is carried out, which also ensures the next state $s'_{t}$ (or $s_{t+1}$) is stable and caused by $a_{t}$. The scheduling of data collection in this way avoids the intererences of subsequent actions, states and rewards thus the signal causality which is crucial for the value estimation.

	\item[Loss tokens]
        \item In case of frame loss, we simply replace the missing data with null elements as loss tokens, which will be utilized for the agent as a learning signal for handling information loss.

	\item[Action clipping]
        \item Action clipping similar to target policy smoothing in TD3 \parencite{TD3:_addres_funct_approx_error_actor_critic_method} is used. For the sake of simplicity, we don't use the double-Q learning or delayed polciy updates. For each training drive, we reload the pedal map from the last drive as the initial map for the current drive. A torque change budget is defined, which should be multiplied by the action value, the $\tanh$ outputs of the actor, to be added to the current pedal map. In our experiment, the torque budget is 200 Nm. The pedal map is then clipped on the lower and upperbound around the initial pedal map of the current drive and further clipping on the allowed maximal torque request.

\end{description}

As a result, For every 3 seconds we get one quartic tuple in Tab.\@\ref{tab:quadruple} which is called a ``record'' and can be fed into the DDPG agent for inference or stored in the replay buffer for sampling batches during the training.

\subsubsection{Episode}\label{sec:episode}

For sequential models like RDPG \parencite{heess15:_memor}, a sequence of states, namely the history, needs to be fed into sequential neural networks. For this purpose, ``episodes'' will be stored in the replay buffer. An episode is a consecutive sequence of records with a start and an end state $e_T=[(s_1,a_1,r_1),\ldots,(s_{N},a_{N},r_{N})]$. Similarly to the data handling for the DDPG agent, null elements are inserted in the episodes as loss tokens if observations are missing, which happens quite often for over-the-air (OTA) vehicle communication interface. In general, episodes have different sequence length, since the termination of an episode could mean reaching the destination with different speeds or events. Therefore the replay buffer for episodes is ususally ragged.

\subsection{Training}\label{sec:training}

When an episode starts, only inference will be done while collecting the states, actions and rewards until the episode ends. Then only after that, the actor and critic are updated with batch sampling from the replay buffer.

As can be seen in Fig.\@\ref{fig:Agent_Powertrain}, the environment of the reinforcement learning model include both the vehicle on the road and the driver. If we fix the same vehicle and test drive on the same site, we expect both to be stationary. We fix the driver for the test as well, since each driver is expected to have fixed driving style. Therefore we assume the driving style also to be stationary. However, since each driver has his own driving style, we monitor the driving style of the driver for analysis of its impact on the overall EOSEV system.

\subsubsection{Driving style}\label{sec:driving style}

	\end{subfigure}\caption{\label{fig:driving styles} Driving styles as distribution of acceleration pedal openings.}
\end{figure}

For each episode we can calculate the distribution of the pedal openings and denote it as driving style. As the baseline we calculate the average distribution of over 70 episdoes with the same driver, vehicle and configurations with the agent switched off. Fig.\@\ref{fig:driving style without agent} shows the baseline distribution, while Fig.\@\ref{fig:driving style with agent} shows the average distribution of the pedal opening with the agent after training has stablilized. We can see that the distribution of the pedal openings tends to have larger variance with the agent, since the driver tries to adapt to the powertrain change induced by the agent. Also both distributions are skewed toward smaller pedal openings as most drivers operate in the less acceleration regime.

		\caption{With agent}\label{fig:style deviation with agent}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{\label{fig:driving styles} KL divergence of episodic style from baseline.}
\end{figure}

We compute the KL-divergence of the distributions of other episodes from the baseline as an evaluation of the driving style drift. To estiamte the driving style with a sequential model is more precise but would add too much complexity to the evaluation process. Fig.\@\ref{fig:kld episodic style} shows the KL-divergence of driving style in each episode from the average, while Fig.\@\ref{fig:style deviation with agent} shows the KL-divergence for around 140 episodes with the agent while the training process goes on for a day of test drives. It can be seen that within a short time range, the KL divergence is smaller than 0.3 and the driving styles both with or without agent are stable.

\subsubsection{Results}\label{sec:results_small}

The test drives are conducted in a proving ground with a fixed vehicle, driver and route and the speed profile defined in Fig.\@\ref{fig:speed profile for traning}. With each episode of around 20 seconds, the breaks bewteen the episodes and occasional interrupts, we are able to finish around 60 consecutive episodes in 3 hours for each test run. Each run reloads the model weights and the pedal map which the last run saved and the agent is continuously updated by the training during the test run. Fig.\@\ref{fig:consumption reduction ddpg} depicts the energy consumption trends for the training of 3 weeks. Each curve corresponds to a test run.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/ddpg-training1.png}
	\caption{Energy consumption reduction during training}\label{fig:consumption reduction ddpg}
\end{figure}

We can see the energy consumption is continuously reduced within each run. The trend of consumption reduction between the runs is prominent as well. During the training, the pedal map is dynamically changed by the agent. Fig.\@\ref{fig:dynamic pedal map} shows a snapshot of the map. We can see in the lower right corner of the pedal map for low speed and small pedal opening that the agent requests larger negative torque to recapture energy from momentum.

\subsection{Public road}\label{sec:public road}

The test drive is extended to open roads where the route is much longer and the scenarios are more complex with traffic lights and pedestrian which in cases makes the vehicle halt. We run baseline drives without the agent in a regular time period to evaluate the training progress, while monitoring the driving style of the human driver. In order to increase the training efficiency, We start from a frozen model trained in Sec.\@\ref{sec:training} and schedule a curriculum to add complexity incrementally to the training.

The map of the first route is shown in Fig.\@\ref{fig:1st route}. The vehicle follows the loop in the clockwise direction so that it always turns right in order not to be halted by the traffic light on the corner. When the vehicle is blocked by pedestrians, the test data is simply abandoned. Fig.\@\ref{fig:openroad a speed} shows the target speed, the upperbound, the lowerbound and the actual test speed. Comparing to the episode in Fig.\@\ref{fig:speed profile for traning}, the first route has right turns and is much longer.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Test drive on the 1st. route\label{fig:open road a}}
\end{figure}

The test drive on the 1st.\@ route takes 9 days over 3 weeks and the result is depicted in Fig.\@\ref{fig:openroad a consumption}. For every week, we run baseline drives while switching off agent and compare the episodes with the agent in the same week with the baseline. The consumption reduction is shown in Tab.\@\ref{tab:openroad a result}. It should be noted that a consumption increase in week 2 is due to a temperature drop, which cause the battery management system to turn on battery heating and increase the overall consumption. This indicates that the EOSEV system is weather resistant. Comparing to each baselines, the average consumption reduction is $7\%\sim8\%$.

In Fig.\@\ref{fig:openroad a style}, the orange and the blue curve correspond to the KL divergence of the episodic driving style with and without the agent respectively. A drift in driving style while training can be seen over around 600 episodes. In the long run, the driving style will be impacted by the agent changing the powertrain behavior, if the driver is exploring a cooperative driving strategy. The agent is adaptive to this change.

\subsubsection{Transferability}\label{sec:transferable}

In order to verify the transferablility, the frozen model trained from the 1st.\@ route is used on the second route in Fig.\@\ref{fig:2nd route}, which has a different target speed profile Fig.\@\ref{fig:openroad b speed}. The result is shown in Fig.\@\ref{fig:openroad b result}. Comparing to the baseline, the consumption reduction with the frozen model without any specific fine-tuning is around 4\%. This indicates an application with a generic pre-training on typical driving scenarios and the deployment of a frozen model on the real roads without training, which will simplify the production architecture and deployment cost drastically at the expense of less performance and adaptability.

In Fig.\@\ref{fig:openroad b style} we can see the KL divergence is smaller than 0.16 and the driving style is not drifting since the agent is frozen.

\subsubsection{Multimodality}\label{sec:multimodal}

The agent should have multimodal policies to handle different scenarios. Without multimodal capability, multimodal data will mean noise to the agent, so that it will not learn the correct strategies for different data modes.  However, neural networks can approximate multimodal functions very well. It's important to verify that the agent can deal with complex multimodal scenarios efficiently.

In order to test the multimodality, we test on the first route but treat halting scenarios due to traffic lights or pedestrians as valid. In test drives we ask the driver to tag the observations of the halting or non-halting state at every right turn for later analysis. Since we have three right turns, this corresponds to 8 modes of data depending states on the right turns to be halted or not. We test for a long time so as to get sufficient sample episodes for each mode. In the analysis, we filter out the different modes for comparison. For each mode, we define the target speed profile, calculate the baseline and the episodic consumption. For the sake of brevity, we only show two modes in Fig.\@\ref{fig:open road mm 000} for not halting at all turns and Fig.\@\ref{fig:open road mm 111} for halting at all turns.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Scenarios for halting at all turns\label{fig:open road mm 111}}
\end{figure}

We can see from the results that the agent can learn multimodal policies to deal with different scenarios. This indicates a generalized training on real roads without specific handling of the observation data.
