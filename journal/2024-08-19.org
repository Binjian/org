*** Pilot project, important
*** Current trends of foundation models/LLMs seems unsustainable, useful but depending now heavily on investment, burning cash, less innovation/technology development, grasping the chance on a sustainable AI method for AV.
*** Solid engineering
**** Good code base, integration architecture (>50%), familiar with interface, design, test coverage, CI/CD, type hinting
**** Python, testing, coverage, integration, type hints, abstraction
**** MOT, Filtering,
**** Integration, quality control, requirement management, customer support
*** build-up a team is highly dynamic, overlapping of responisbility, pro-activity, feeling to get involved, very good cooperation and transparency to the local team (implementation) and global team (support);
*** good communictation with the  customer (support)
*** Technical/management (Technical management consists of both)
**** planning & analysis, backup solutions, changes
**** show authority, confidence
**** Customer support, supervision, guidance
**** agility
**** resource allocation
**** key factor identificiation
**** team orchestration,
**** people's capability & motivation & resource, balance and compromises
*** overtaking a team is to be familiar with every team member. Keep communication to feel involved.
*** flat vs architectured: everyone feels respected for startup work together, team size growth, necessary to have team leads; delegation: trust with double-checking
